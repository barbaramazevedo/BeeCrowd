# 🐝 BeeCrowd — Problem 1016: Distance

## 📌 Problem Description

Two cars, **X** and **Y**, travel in the same direction:

- Car **X** moves at a constant speed of **60 km/h**
- Car **Y** moves at a constant speed of **90 km/h**

In **1 hour (60 minutes)**, car **Y** increases its distance from car **X** by **30 km**.  
This means that car **Y** gets **1 km farther every 2 minutes**.

Given a distance (in kilometers), calculate how long it takes (in **minutes**) for car **Y** to obtain this distance relative to car **X**.

⚠️ Pay attention to the output format:
- Print the result on **a single line**
- Include **one space** between the number and the word
- The output must be followed by the message **"minutos"**
- Print a **line break** after the result
