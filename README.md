# 🐝 BeeCrowd — Problem 1011: Sphere

## 📌 Problem Description

Make a program that calculates and prints the **volume of a sphere**, given the value of its **radius (R)**.

The formula to calculate the volume is:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times R^3
\]

Consider the value of **π = 3.14159**.

💡 Tip: Use `(4 / 3.0)` or `(4.0 / 3)` in your formula to avoid integer division issues in some programming languages.

⚠️ Pay attention to the output format:

- Include a **space before and after** the equal sign (`=`)
- Print a **line break** after the result
- The value must be displayed with **three decimal places**

---

## 📥 Input

The input contains:

- **1 floating-point value** (double precision), representing the radius of the sphere

---

## 📤 Output

Print a message in the following format:

VOLUME = X

Where **X** is the calculated volume, displayed with **three decimal places**.
